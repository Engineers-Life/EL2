				"Floormats will provide you with a unique method of sending redstone signals in your base. They follow vanilla pressure plate mechanics relatively, wooden plates can be triggered by items, mobs, and players, and stone plates can only be triggered by mobs and players. What the mod introduces though, is metal plates that can only be activated by players.",
				"The mod also introduces gold pressure plates that will only be activated by the placing player, (a sort of security to activation). These plates are expanded into gilded versions of wooden plates that will act the same.",
				"Connections can be managed by right clicking with a stick to break and reconnect connections between mats. By using a ender pearl on any two mats they will be linked, right clicking twice will remove the link.",
				"Floormats come in a variety of materials which can be found in JEI."
